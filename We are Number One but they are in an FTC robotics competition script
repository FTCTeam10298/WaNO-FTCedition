Robbie: “Are you, uh, a real villain?”
Bobbie: “Well, uh, technically... nah.”
Robbie: “Have you ever caught a good guy, like, uh, like a real superhero?”
Bobbie: “Nah.”
Robbie: “Have you ever tried a disguise?”
Bobbie: “Nah, nah...”
Robbie: “Alright! I can see that I will have to teach you how to be villains!”



Now listen closely
Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down is history
If you wanna be a villian number one
You have to chase a superhero on the run
Just follow my moves, and sneak around
Be careful not to make a sound
Shhhh...
No! Don't touch that

Ha Ha Ha
Now look at this net that I just found
When I say go, be ready to throw
And go!
Throw it at him not me!
Uh, let's try something else
Now watch and learn, here's the deal
You slip and slide on this banana peel
Ha ha ha
What are you doing?!?

Villian number one!

Robbie: “Are you, uh, a real robot builder?”
Bobbie: “Well, uh, technically, ah... nah.”
Robbie: “Have you ever capped a cap ball, like, uh, like a real expert team?”
Bobbie: “Nah.”
Robbie: “Have you ever tried programming in Java?”
Bobbie: “Nah, nah...”
Robbie: “Alright! I can see that I will have to teach you how to be robot builders!”


Now listen closely
Here's a little lesson in strategy
This is going down is history
If you wanna be alliance number one
You have to chase a cap ball on the run

Just follow my lead, and drive around
Be careful not to pull a wire
No! Don't touch that


Now look at this ball that I just got
When I say go, be ready to launch
And go!
Throw it in red, not blue!
Uh, let's try something else

Now watch and learn, here's the deal
You turn these beacons from red to blue
<!-- Ha ha ha -->
What are you doing?!?


Team number one!
