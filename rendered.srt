1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,300
Are you a, a real robot builder?

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,300
Well, uh, technically, ah... nah.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,400
Have you ever capped a cap ball, like, uh, like a real expert team?

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Nah.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,900
Have you ever tried programming in Java?

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,500
Nah, nah...

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,300
Alright! I can see that I will have to teach you how to be robot builders!

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Hey!

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
We are number one, hey!

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,200
We are number one

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,100
Now listen closely

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,000
Here's a little lesson in strategy

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
This is going down is history

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,400
If you wanna be alliance number one

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,900
You have to chase a cap ball on the run

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Just follow my lead, and drive around

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Be careful not to pull a wire

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
No! Don't touch that

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,150
We are number one, hey!

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,700
We are number one

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Hey!

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,300
We are number one

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,000
Now look at this ball that I just got

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,000
When I say go, be ready to launch

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
And go!

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Throw it in red, not blue!

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,300
Uh, let's try something else

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,200
Now watch and learn, here's the deal

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
You turn these beacons from blue to red

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
What are you doing?!?

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Hey!

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We are number one, hey!

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,500
Robot number one!

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hey!

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Hey!

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
We are number one, hey!

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,600
We are number one, we are number one

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,600
We are number one, hey hey!
